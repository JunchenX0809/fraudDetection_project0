# Fraud Detection Project

A machine learning project to identify fraudulent transactions in financial data.

## Overview
This project uses supervised learning to detect fraud in transaction records. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with very few fraud cases compared to non-fraud.

## Methods Used
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - One-hot encoding for categorical variables (e.g., transaction type)
  - Standardization of numerical features
- **Models:**
  - Logistic Regression (with class balancing)
  - Random Forest Classifier (with class balancing)

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook `main_code_file1.ipynb` to see the full workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation.
